# 📝 To-Do List App

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple and colorful to-do list app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a personal project to help me practice my front-end skills — and I wanted it to look cute and clean at the same time!

With this app, you can:
- Add new tasks
- Edit or delete them
- Mark them as completed
- Clear all tasks at once
- Switch between pastel, light, and dark themes
- And best part — your tasks stay saved even if you refresh the page 💾 (thanks to local storage!)

## 💻 Tech Used
- **HTML** – for structure  
- **CSS** – for styling (I used a pastel theme because... why not?)  
- **JavaScript** – to make everything work and interact

## 🌐 Live Demo

## 📱 Responsive Design
I made sure it works on mobile too! You can use it on your phone, tablet, or laptop without any layout issues.

## 💡 Why I built it
I wanted to build something fun, useful, and visually appealing while learning how to:
- Use localStorage in JavaScript
- Work with DOM elements
- Make a responsive layout
- Add theme switching to a webpage

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me
Hi! I'm Vinny (Sai Poojitha), a student who loves tech, design, and learning new things in web development. I’m still growing, but this project is a small step toward becoming the kind of developer I dream of being someday 💖
